# another_fractal_generator

Should probably work on linux, was tested on termux(android).
<br>

## Installation
Requirements:
```sh
pip install numpy Pillow cython
```
<br>

```sh
git clone https://github.com/Ar57m/another_fractal_generator
cd another_fractal_generator
sh start.sh
```

<br>
start.sh builds and runs the generator, once is built you can just run(unless you changed something in fractal_generator.pyx):

```sh
python runner.py
```
